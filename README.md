# Texas 4000 - Lance
Lance is the second iteration of Texas 4000's [RMS](https://github.com/ethanperez/t4k-rms). It is a central-tracking system that allows Texas 4000 leadership and teammembers to log miles and incident reports, as well as displaying central team information.

## The Initial Problem
As a small non-profit, Texas 4000's resources are restrained, especially with automated tasks. Google Forms and paper incident reports made life a lot harder than it should be. As a member of Texas 4000 at the time of RMS' creation, I wanted to:
  1. Create value for an organization in a simple and unobtrusive way 
  2. Allow myself to build and expiriment with a new technology stack
  3. Build a sustainable system that could be used and upgraded for future teams


## Access
RMS is available to current Texas 4000 teammembers and staff at [rms.texas4000.org](http://rms.texas4000.org).
